# chained-elements

The objective of this repo is to implement "GameObject Transform" functionality similar to what's found in the Unity game engine. Specifically, the goal is to create a system where objects can be positioned relative to their parent objects.

In Unity, a GameObject can have a parent GameObject, and its position is affected by the parent's position. This allows for the creation of hierarchical arrangements of objects that can be easily manipulated as a single unit. The aim of this repo is to create a similar system that can be used outside of the Unity environment.
